## Introduction

Hello Platform Science and welcome to my code challenge! I appreciate you taking the time to see what I am capable of in regards to writing API tests. If you are familiar with my resume, you may know that I do not have a background in testing. This has been quite the challenge and I admit, spending time learning the different aspects of testing has really opened my eyes to how important it is and how TDD could help shape an engineer's code. It has completely changed the way I will be approaching writing my code in the future. I tried to approach testing the API in several areas. The first was testing the actual response from the API itself along with error testing. The second area I tested was the API's ability to process the movement commands and the wall collision. The final area I focused on was the Hoover's hoovering ability. I have separated these three areas of testing for ease of reading. I am extremely excited to hear your notes on the tests I wrote. As we all know, PR's are a great opportunity to learn from a more experienced developer and I am truly looking forward to understanding how I can improve my tests and how to approach writing tests from the perspective of an SDET. Thank you for taking the time to read this and review my code. Have a great day!


## Running The Tests
To run
1. cd into the directory the project is in and type in the terminal:
    npm install
2. I have set up the npm test command to run any JS file with "_test.js" at the end of the file name. This will run 3 different test JS files. To run the tests type in terminal:
    npm test
